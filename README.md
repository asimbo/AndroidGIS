# Android GIS

## App introduction:


This is a native GIS plantform made for Android.

This application is based on [spatialite-android](http://code.google.com/p/spatialite-android/).
But as you known,spatialite-android just is a geodatabase library, how can we show the data in view? The purpose of this app is to solve it.

## Installation

Just import it into eclipse and then run.

**Note:** *I have compiled the source code of spatialite-android  and got two file "/libs/armeabi/libjsqlite.so" and "/libs/spatialite-android-library.jar" ,and then I copy them into this project.*
